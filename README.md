# battleship

This project is about battleship, where you have to hit the enemy ships without seeing them!

This project is part of <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship'>TheOdinProject</a>

This is my first using Jest for my testing. I've learned that I should test first rather than test afterwards.
